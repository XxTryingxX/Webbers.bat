# Webbers.bat
My first malware 
MAKE SURE THE FILE IS IN DESKTOP

The first lines of code send the file to startup

the code under the move code from startup opens up 18+ websites designed to just be a prank it is a mostly safe malware 
as long as you have access to your startup folder and your default browser doesnt open up full screen
can crash the pc
